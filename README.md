<h1>Coop's Questions - Good questions skim the surface, Great questions drive meaningful connection.</h1> 

## Description:
This project is intended for use by new friends, old friends, family, or anyone you hope to get closer to and have some fun in the process. So often are we paralyzed by social interaction, and the nerves that come along for the ride, that we don't even begin to converse with each other, resorting to small talk; yes, I've been doing well, the weather is good, so was my weekend. While you may not want to get into personal details with coworkers, this project offers a variety of (growing) categories and questions to spark up conversations with each other; spend some time debating whether savory or sweet is better, or maybe come to the realization that you both love the same movies. For those who seek to enrich or rebuild existing relationships with friends or family, there are even more questions for you. Sometimes all it takes is one question to open the door to connection.
